# Tokenization and Encryption of Sensitive Data

In this module, we will learn on how to use [Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) to develop Serverless Tokenization solution. Lambda Layers package dependencies and custom runtime which can be imported by Lambda Function. This module is designed to enable development of applications by loosely coupling security from the application so that only security team has access to sensitive data. Application team can develop applications which can import the Lambda Layer provided by security team. This eases the development and reuse of code across teams. 

## Tokenization vs Encryption 

Tokenization is an alternative to encryption that helps to protect certain parts of the data that has high sensitivity or a specific regulatory compliance requirement such as PCI. Separating the sensitive data into its own dedicated, secured data store and using tokens in its place helps you avoid the potential cost and complexity of end-to-end encryption. It also allows you to reduce risk with temporary, one-time-use tokens. [More Info](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/best-practices-for-securing-sensitive-data-in-aws-data-stores/)

## How? 

We will use [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) to create and control the encryption keys. We will then create [customer managed master  key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys) which will be used by [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) client encryption library to encrypt the plain text. We will also use CloudFormation template to create DynamoDB Table and Lambda Layer which contains  encryption logic and dependent libraries. This Lambda Layer will be imported into Lambda Function which handles the request and response for our application. The application gets the sensitive data (for example, credit card information) from the end user, passes it to Lambda function that invokes the imported layer to exchange sensitive data with unique token. This token is stored in application database (DynamoDB) and the sensitive data is stored by Lambda Layer in separate database (DynamoDB) which can be managed by security team. When required, the encrypted data can be decrypted by providing the token stored in the application database.
We additionally use AWS X-Ray to create tracing for the solution, which allows us to monitor and analyze the performance of our application, identify bottlenecks, and gain deeper insights into the interactions and dependencies within our distributed system. By integrating AWS X-Ray, we can trace requests as they travel through the various components of our application, ensuring better visibility and facilitating quicker debugging and optimization.

Please note we use the DynamoDB Encryption Client, which has been renamed to the AWS Database Encryption SDK but is still supported by AWS.

 ## Architecture Diagram
 ![Architecture](images/Lambda-Layer.png)
 
 ## Step 1: Environment
Before you start working with this repository, ensure that your development environment is properly set up. First, make sure you have your preferred IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, installed. 

 You will use a command line terminal to run the commands mentioned in the next steps. You can use your laptop with IAM permissions setup to deploy the code on AWS Account. For setting up AWS CLI and IAM permissions for accessing AWS services from your laptop, refer to documentation [Authentication and access credentials for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)

Verify that the AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly with your credentials. This will allow you to interact with AWS services seamlessly from your local environmentL

 ```bash
 aws sts get-caller-identity
 ```

*Note* - 

 ## Step 2: Create S3 Bucket
 We need [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html) bucket for [AWS Serverless Application Model(SAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) to package and deploy serverless resources. AWS SAM is an open source framework for building serverless applications on AWS to build and deploy SAM templates (template.yaml). Replace `unique-s3-bucket-name` with a unique value in the following code to create S3 bucket.
 
 **Note** S3 Bucket names are globally unique across all AWS customers, so *make sure you specify a unique bucket name*. Donâ€™t worry if the name is already taken, the command will fail and you can just retry with a different name.
 
 ```bash
 aws s3 mb s3://<unique-s3-bucket-name>
 ```
 The output will look like 
 
 ```bash
make_bucket: <unique-s3-bucket-name>
 ```
 
 ## Step 3: Initialize and Clone Git 
 
 Use the below code to initialize and clone this git repository
 
 ```bash
 git init
 git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-tokenization.git
 ```
 
 Once the git repository is cloned, check the directories. The output will look like the following structure:
 
 ![Git Cloned](images/git-clone-results.png)
 
 ## Step 4: Create Customer Managed KMS Key
 
**Step 4.1** Go to encryption_keys directory

```bash
cd aws-serverless-tokenization/src/encryption_keys
```
 
**Step 4.2** Build the SAM template (template.yaml)

```bash
sam build --use-container
```
 
The output will look like 
![build-success](images/build-success.png)
 
**Step 4.3** Package the code and push to S3 Bucket. Replace `unique-s3-bucket-name` with the value identified in Step 2

```bash
sam package --s3-bucket <unique-s3-bucket-name> --output-template-file packaged.yaml
```
 
The output will look like 
![package-success](images/sam-package.png)


**Step 4.4** Packaged.yaml (created in the above step) will be used to deploy the code and resources to AWS. Wait for the stack creation to complete. Note the name of the stack is `kms-stack`

```bash
sam deploy --template-file ./packaged.yaml --stack-name kms-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Once done, the output will look like

![deploy-success](images/kms-stack.png)

**Step 4.5** Get the output variables of the stack 

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name kms-stack
```

Once done, the output will look like

```json
"Outputs": [
                {
                    "Description": "ARN for CMS Key created", 
                    "OutputKey": "KMSKeyID", 
                    "OutputValue": "*********"
                }
            ]
```

Note the *OutputValue* of  *OutputKey* `KMSKeyID` from the output for later steps.

Here, in Step 4, the CloudFormation stack created customer managed KMS key and gave permissions to the root user to access the key. This master encryption key will be used to generate data encryption keys for encrypting items later in the module. 

## Step 5: Create Lambda Layer for String Tokenization and Encrypted Data Store

**Step 5.1** Go to tokenizer directory 

```bash
cd ../../../aws-serverless-tokenization/src/tokenizer/
```

**Step 5.2** Run the script to compile and install the dependent libraries in *dynamodb-client/python/* directory. For Lambda Function, we can include `--use container` in `sam build` command to achieve this but for Lambda Layer, we need to download the Lambda docker image to compile dependent libraries for Amazon Linux Image. [More details on this](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/3051?source=post_page-----f3e228470659----------------------)

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine by verifying with docker --version. Docker Buildx is included with Docker versions 19.03 and above, but you can check if it's installed by running docker buildx version. Utilizing Buildx enables better performance and cost-efficiency, especially when building for architectures like AWS Graviton.

Run the following command to build an image for the tokenization Lambda layer:

```bash
./build.sh
```

**Step 5.3** Build the SAM template (template.yaml)

```bash
sam build --use-container
```

After the build is successful, the output will look like 

![build-success](images/build-success.png)

**Step 5.4** Copy the python files `ddb_encrypt_item.py` and `hash_gen.py` to *dynamodb-client/python/*. This is required since Lambda Layer expects files to be in a specific directory to be used by Lambda function. [More details on this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html#configuration-layers-path)

`ddb_encrypt_item.py` â€“ This file contains the logic to encrypt and decrypt the plain text and store encrypted information in DynamoDB table.

`hash_gen.py` - This file contains the logic to create UUID tokens for strings which will be provided to the end application in exchange for sensitive data, for example, credit card. 

```bash
cp ddb_encrypt_item.py hash_gen.py dynamodb-client/python/
```

**Step 5.5** Package the code and push to S3 Bucket. Replace `unique-s3-bucket-name` with the value identified in Step 2

```bash
sam package --s3-bucket <unique-s3-bucket-name> --output-template-file packaged.yaml
```
 
The output will look like 

![package-success](images/tokenizer-stack-package.png)

**Step 5.6** Similar to Step 4.4, create CloudFormation stack using the below code to create resources and deploy your code. Wait for the stack creation to complete. Note the name of the stack is `tokenizer-stack`

```bash
sam deploy --template-file ./packaged.yaml --stack-name tokenizer-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

The output will look like 
![tokenizer-stack](images/tokenizer-stack.png)

**Step 5.7** Get the output variables of the stack

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name tokenizer-stack
```

The output will look like 

```json
"Outputs": [
                {
                    "Description": "ARN for the published Layer version", 
                    "ExportName": "TokenizeData", 
                    "OutputKey": "LayerVersionArn", 
                    "OutputValue": "***********"
                }
            ]
```

Note the *OutputValue* of `LayerVersionArn` from the output for later steps.

Here, in Step 5, the CloudFormation stack created a  Lamda Layer for encrypting/decrypting the sensitive data and generating unique tokens for sensitive data.

## Step 6: Create Serverless Application 

Letâ€™s build the Serveless application which contains API gateway for API management, Lambda Function for application code, Lambda Layer to import reusable code that we created earlier and Cognito user pool for API authentication

**Step 6.1** Go to CustomerApp directory which has Serverless Application code and SAM template.
 
 ```bash
 cd ../../../aws-serverless-tokenization/src/CustomerApp/
 ```
 
**Step 6.2** Build SAM template. Replace the parameters with previously noted values for `LayerVersionArn` (Step 5.7)

```bash
sam build --use-container --parameter-overrides layerarn=<LayerVersionArn>
```

After the build is successful, the output will look like 

![build-success](images/build-success.png)


**Step 6.3** Package the code and push to S3 Bucket. Replace `unique-s3-bucket-name` with the value identified in Step 2

```bash
sam package --s3-bucket <unique-s3-bucket-name> --output-template-file packaged.yaml
```
 
The output will look like 
![package-success](images/sam-package.png)

**Step 6.4** Similar to Step 4.4, deploy code and resources to AWS using the packaged.yaml. Note the name of the stack is `app-stack`. 

Replace the parameters with previously noted values for `LayerVersionArn` (Step 5.7), `KMSKeyID` (Step 4.5)

```bash
sam deploy --template-file ./packaged.yaml --stack-name app-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --parameter-overrides layerarn=<LayerVersionArn> kmsid=<KMSArn>
```
![app-stack](images/app-stack.png)

**Step 6.5** Get the output variables of the stack

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name app-stack
```

The output will look like

```json
"Outputs": [
    {
        "Description": "Customer Order Lambda Function ARN", 
        "OutputKey": "CustomerOrderFunction", 
        "OutputValue": "*******************:app-stack-CustomerOrderFunction*******"
    }, 
    {
        "Description": "API Gateway endpoint URL for CustomerOrderFunction", 
        "OutputKey": "PaymentMethodApiURL", 
        "OutputValue": "https://*****************/dev/"
    }, 
    {
        "Description": "AWS Account Id", 
        "OutputKey": "AccountId", 
        "OutputValue": "********"
    }, 
    {
        "Description": "User Pool App Client for your application", 
        "OutputKey": "UserPoolAppClientId", 
        "OutputValue": "********************"
    }, 
    {
        "Description": "Region", 
        "OutputKey": "Region", 
        "OutputValue": "*************"
    }, 
    {
        "Description": "User Pool Arn for the cognito pool", 
        "OutputKey": "UserPoolArn", 
        "OutputValue": "arn:aws:cognito-idp:**:**:userpool/********"
    }, 
    {
        "Description": "Implicit IAM Role created for Hello World function", 
        "OutputKey": "LambdaExecutionRole", 
        "OutputValue": "******app-stack-LambdaExecutionRole-****"
    }
]
```
Note the *OutputValue* of *OutputKey* `LambdaExecutionRole`, `PaymentMethodApiURL` , `AccountId` , `UserPoolAppClientId` and `Region` from the output for later steps.

**Step 6.6** Update KMS permissions to allow Lambda Function to generate data keys for encryption. This will ensure you are adhering to least privilege principles. You will need the `LambdaExecutionRole` and `AccountId` from step 6.5, the KMS ARN from step 4.5. Replace the key values below and run the following command:

```bash
export KMSArn="<KMSArn>"
export ROOTPrincipal="arn:aws:iam::<AccountId>:root"
export LambdaExecutionRole="<LambdaExecutionRole>"
```

```bash
POLICY=$(cat << EOF
{ 
    "Version": "2012-10-17", 
    "Id": "key-default-1", 
    "Statement": [ 
        { 
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions", 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Principal": {"AWS": ["$ROOTPrincipal"]}, 
            "Action": "kms:*", 
            "Resource": "$KMSArn" 
        }, 
        { 
            "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions", 
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Principal": {"AWS": ["$LambdaExecutionRole"]}, 
            "Action": ["kms:Decrypt", "kms:Encrypt", "kms:GenerateDataKey", "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext"], 
            "Resource": "$KMSArn" 
        } 
    ] 
}
EOF
); \
aws kms put-key-policy --key-id "$KMSArn" --policy-name default --policy "$POLICY"
```


**Step 6.7** Create a Cognito user with the following code. Replace `Region` and `UserPoolAppClientId` with values noted in  the previous step. Also, provide a **valid** email in place of `user-email` and `password`. Note: you should have access to the email provided to get the verification code. The password should be minimum 6 characters long, should contain at least one lower case and one upper case character.  

```bash
aws cognito-idp sign-up --region <Region> --client-id <UserPoolAppClientId> --username <user-email> --password <password>
```
The output will look like 

```json
{
    "UserConfirmed": false, 
    "UserSub": "************", 
    "CodeDeliveryDetails": {
        "AttributeName": "email", 
        "Destination": "<user-email>", 
        "DeliveryMedium": "EMAIL"
    }
}
```

**Step 6.8** Lets verify the Cognito user we just created  

**Note** â€“ Replace `CONFIRMATION_CODE_IN_EMAIL` with the verification code recieved in the email provided in the previous step. 

```bash
aws cognito-idp confirm-sign-up --client-id <UserPoolAppClientId>  --username <user-email> --confirmation-code <CONFIRMATION_CODE_IN_EMAIL>
```

**Note** â€“ There will be no output for this command.

**Step 6.9** Generate ID token for API authentication. Replace `UserPoolAppClientId` with value noted in step 6.5. Also replace `user-email` and `password` with the same values provided in step 6.6. 

```bash
aws cognito-idp initiate-auth --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH --client-id <UserPoolAppClientId> --auth-parameters USERNAME=<user-email>,PASSWORD=<password>
```

The output will look like 

```json 
{
    "AuthenticationResult": {
        "ExpiresIn": 3600, 
        "IdToken": "*********", 
        "RefreshToken": "******", 
        "TokenType": "Bearer", 
        "AccessToken": "********"
    }, 
    "ChallengeParameters": {}
}
```
Note the value of `IdToken` from the output for next steps.

Now, we will invoke APIs to test the application. There are two APIs - 
1. **order** - The first API i.e. *order* is to create the customer order, generate the token for credit card number (using Lambda Layer) and store encrypted credit card number in another DynamoDB table called `CreditCardTokenizerTable` (as specified in the Lambda Layer) and finally store the customer information along with the credit card token in DynamoDB table called `CustomerOrderTable`. 
2. **paybill** - The second API i.e. *paybill* takes the `CustomerOrder` number and fetches credit card token from  `CustomerOrderTable` and calls decrypt method in Lambda Layer to get the deciphered credit card number. 

**Step 6.10** Let's call */order* API to create the order with the following code. Replace the value of `PaymentMethodApiURL` (Step 6.5) and `IdToken` (Step 6.8) with the values identified in the previous steps. 

```bash
curl -X POST \
 <PaymentMethodApiURL>/order \
-H 'Authorization: <IdToken>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"CustomerOrder": "123456789",
"CustomerName": "Amazon Web Services",
"CreditCard": "0000-0000-0000-0000",
"Address": "Reinvent2019, Las Vegas, USA"
}'
```

The output will look like 

```json
{"message": "Order Created Successfully", "CreditCardToken": "*************"}
````

**Step 6.11** Let's call */paybill* API to pay the bill using the previously provided information. Replace the value of `PaymentMethodApiURL` (Step 6.5) and `IdToken` (Step 6.8) with the values identified in the previous steps. 

```bash
curl -X POST \
 <PaymentMethodApiURL>/paybill \
-H 'Authorization: <IdToken>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"CustomerOrder": "123456789"
}'
```

The output will look like 

```json
{"message": "Payment Submitted Successfully", "CreditCard Charged": "0000-0000-0000-0000"}
````

Application has created the customer order with required details and saved the plain text information (generated credit card token) in DynamoDB table called `CustomerOrdeTable` and encrypted `CreditCard` information is stored in another DynamoDB table called `CreditCardTokenizerTable`. Now, check the values in both the tables to see what items are stored. 

**Step 6.12** Get the items stored in `CustomerOrdeTable`

```bash
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name CustomerOrderTable --key '{ "CustomerOrder" : { "S": "123456789" }  }'
```

The output will look like 

```json
{
    "Item": {
        "CustomerOrder": {
            "S": "123456789"
        }, 
        "Address": {
            "S": "Reinvent2019, Las Vegas, USA"
        }, 
        "CustomerName": {
            "S": "Amazon Web Services"
        }, 
        "CreditCardToken": {
            "S": "**********"
        }
    }
}
```

Note the value of `CreditCardToken`. It will be the generated token value and not actual `CreditCard` provided by the end user.

**Step 6.13** Get the items stored in `CreditCardTokenizerTable`. Replace the value of `CreditCardToken` (Step 6.11) and `AccountId` (Step 6.5) with previously identified values.

```bash
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name CreditCardTokenizerTable --key '{ "Hash_Key" : { "S": "<CreditCardToken>" }, "Account_Id" : { "S" : "<AccountId>" }  }'
```

The output will look like 

```json
{
    "Item": {
        "*amzn-ddb-map-sig*": {
            "B": "**************"
        }, 
        "*amzn-ddb-map-desc*": {
            "B": "**************"
        }, 
        "Hash_Key": {
            "S": "***************"
        }, 
        "Account_Id": {
            "S": "***************"
        }, 
        "CandidateString": {
            "B": "*****************"
        }
    }

```

Note the value of `CandidateString`. It will be the encrypted value of `CreditCard` instead of the plain text. 

Here, in step 6, the CloudFormation stack created DynamoDB table for storing customer order information, Lambda function for handling request and response, APIs for creating order and paying bill and Cognito user pool for API authentication. In order to verify application functionality, we created a Cognito user to call the APIs and validated plain text (generated token) in `CustomerOrderTable` and encrypted credit card information in `CreditCardTokenizerTable` DynamoDB tables.  

## Step 7: Clean up and delete the resources

Delete the three CloudFormation stacks created (Steps 4, 5 and 6) and S3 bucket. Replace the value of `unique-s3-bucket-name` with the name of the bucket created earlier in Step 2.

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name app-stack

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name tokenizer-stack

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name kms-stack

aws s3 rb s3://<unique-s3-bucket-name> --force
```
